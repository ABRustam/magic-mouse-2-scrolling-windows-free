# Magic Mouse 2 Scrolling on Windows 10

## General Notes
* There are a couple paid programs out there that will get scrolling working for your magic mouse. The most popular one asks you to buy a _subscription_ license. **No thanks*..
* There are some tutorials that suggest downloading Apple BootCamp drivers from the Apple support site. This will **not** work for the Magic Mouse 2.
